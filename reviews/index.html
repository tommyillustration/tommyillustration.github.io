<p><i>"It's impossible to describe how incredible the process of working with Tommy has been. It's almost magical that I was able to give him a poem and he was able to bring it to life in the most beautiful way I ever could have imagined. I cried the first time I opened his draft, it was that good. He was professional, kind, responsive, and very easy to work with. I will definitely be using his talent in the future. I cannot wait to see this book in print. Thank you, Tommy, for everything!"</i></p>

<p><i>"Tommy's work was awesome. Those I have shown it to so far have all mentioned the quality and connection that were present between the words and illustrations. I would definitely work with Tommy on a future project. He did a great job staying true to my thoughts while also adding elements that were able to bring more life to the story. His artwork is beautiful and I can't wait to have this book on my bookshelf."</i></p>

<p style="text-align: center;"><b>The Illustrated Guide To Bitcoin - Andrea Maesani (2023)</b></p>
<p><i>"I had the privilege of working with Tommy for an illustrated book project. Tommy is an exceptional illustrator who consistently went above and beyond expectations. Tommy provided illustrations of impeccable quality, and accommodated all requests with care and precision. He brought a lot of ideas and creativity into drawing great illustrations. Tommy had a very friendly interaction with my coauthor and myself which made the entire work together easy and pleasant. We couldn't be more grateful for his outstanding contributions to our book project, and we highly recommend him to anyone who needs a professional illustrator!"</i></p>
